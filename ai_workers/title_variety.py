"""Keeps generated titles from converging on each other.

Every post is drafted from the same brand kit and the same company facts, so
the title model gravitates to the same handful of shapes ("한복 업사이클링으로
완성한 ...", "... 더봄봄의 특별한 ..."). Two layers, matching the
verify-don't-just-instruct pattern used for compliance and SEO density:

1. Recent titles go into the drafting prompt as "avoid these".
2. The result is scored against history deterministically, and only a title
   that's still too close costs a corrective LLM call.

The comparison deliberately ignores the brand name and the SEO keywords.
Those are *required* to repeat — `title_keyword_coverage` exists to force a
target keyword into every title — so scoring raw strings would rate every
compliant title as a near-duplicate and fire a rewrite every single time.
What actually needs to vary is the phrasing around them.
