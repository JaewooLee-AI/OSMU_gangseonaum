"""Keyword demand vs. competition, via NCP NAVER API HUB.

`seo_optimizer` decides which brand keywords a post should carry, but it
picks them from the draft alone — it can tell that a post is *about* 한복
without knowing whether 한복 is a term anyone searches for, or one that
3.6 million existing blog posts are already fighting over. This module
supplies the missing half.

Two signals, both from API HUB on one key:

  demand      — 검색어트렌드 ratio. Relative, not absolute: a request
                normalizes its groups so the busiest scores 100.
  competition — 블로그 검색 `total`, the number of posts already ranking
                for the term.

The ranking is therefore *ordinal*: it says 'A is a better bet than B for
this brand', never 'A gets N searches a month'. Absolute volume needs the
검색광고 API (광고주센터), which is a different vendor, a different key and
an HMAC-signed protocol; `estimated_volume` is left as the seam for it.

Unlike the LLM calls in this package, every request here is billed against a
monthly quota, so nothing calls the network directly — see `_request`.
